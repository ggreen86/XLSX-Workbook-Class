# XLSX Workbook

Read from and write to XLSX format files without any automation or export with support for full cell formatting in Excel

## Release 40

Minor update to allow the GetCellValue() method to retrieve the cell value for a cell that has a formula.  The formula must be first calculated by another spreadsheet program such as MS Excel; the method for adding a formula to a cell does not calculate the cell value.
